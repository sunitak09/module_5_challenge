# Analysis of Drug Treatment on Mouse Tumor Volume


Following observations are made with the statistical analysis of drug treatments on mice for tumor volume.

1)	The mean (± std. dev) values was lowest for in the range of 40.2 ± 4.8 to 55.2 ± 8.2 for the drugs. 
2)	Variance was in the range of 23.5 to 68.5 for each drug regimen.
3)	Out of the total drug volume, drug Capomulin has the highest influence and Propriva has the lowest influence on the tumor control of mice.
4)	Comparing the mouse gender, male mice had 51% and female had 49% of total effect of drugs.
5)	Drug ‘Ceftamin’ had the highest variance from the mean and data was skewed. All the drug data doesn’t show extreme value except for Infubinol which shows one outlier.
6)	The scatterplot showed the direct linear relation between Tumor Volume and weight of mice. 
7)	The correlation coeff. Value (r = 0.8) show positive and high correlation values. That means there is direct effect of the drugs in controlling the tumor in mice. 

This is concluded that drugs have positive role in controlling the tumor growth. The gender of mice doesn’t show any significant difference in the tumor treatment.
